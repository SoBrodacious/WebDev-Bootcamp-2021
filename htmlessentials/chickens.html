        <p>The <b>chicken</b> (Gallus gallus domesticus), a subspecies of the red junglefowl, is a type of domesticated
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fowl">fowl</a>,
            originally
            from Southeastern Asia. Rooster or cock is a term for an adult male bird. A younger male may be called a
            cockerel; a
            male that has been castrated is a capon. The adult female bird is called a hen. "Chicken" was originally a
            term
            only
            for
            an immature, or at least young, bird, but thanks to its usage on restaurant menus has now become the most
            common
            term
            for the subspecies in general, especially in American English. In older sources common fowl or domestic fowl
            were
            typically used for this.
        </p>

        <p>Originally raised for cockfighting or for special ceremonies, chickens were not kept for food until the
            Hellenistic
            period (4th–2nd centuries BCE).[1][2] Humans now keep chickens primarily as a source of food (consuming both
            their
            meat
            and eggs) and as pets.</p>

        <p>Chickens are one of the most common and widespread domestic animals, with a total population of 23.7 billion
            as
            of
            2018,[3] up from more than 19 billion in 2011.[4] There are more chickens in the world than any other
            bird.[4]
            There
            are numerous cultural references to chickens – in myth, folklore and religion, and in language and
            literature.
        </p>

        <p>Genetic studies have pointed to multiple maternal origins in South Asia, Southeast Asia, and East Asia,[5]
            but
            the
            clade found in the Americas, Europe, the Middle East and Africa originated from the Indian subcontinent.
            From
            ancient India, the chicken spread to Lydia in western Asia Minor, and to Greece by the 5th century BCE.[6]
            Fowl
            have
            been known in Egypt since the mid-15th century BCE, with the "bird that gives birth every day" having come
            from
            the
            land between Syria and Shinar, Babylonia, according to the annals of Thutmose III.[7][8][9]</p>
